**I. Descirption**

This Project is implemented by using different libraries in Python. In this project I have Analyzed the data by using "Pandas" & "Numpy", And shown it into a Graphical format by using Visualization tools like "Seaborn", & "Matplotlib".

**II. Technology Stack**

Language: **Python**

IDE used: **Jupyter Notebook**

**III. Objective**

    
**I. Implement a Basic Analysis using Python Pandas:**
       
1. Check Shape Of the DataFrame
       
2. Check Top Rows in the DataFrame
       
3. Check for data types and null count in the dataframe
       
4. Check for null values in the dataframe
       
5. Change column name
       
6. Show the count elements in the DataFrame
       
7. Display the Data Types in the DataFrmae
       
8. Check for the Duplicates
   
**II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

1. Show the number Trophies collected by all the Teams by using Countplot & Bar Chart

2. Display the Number of Trophies collected by Each Team respectively starting from (2008 to 2023) using Bar Chart

3. Display Each Team Presence in the Finals by using Bar Chart

4. Display Fair Play Awards Collected by Each Team by using Bar Chart

5. Display Number of Orange Cap's Collected by Every Team by using Bar Chart

6. Check for number Purple Cap's Secured by each Team by using Bar Chart

7. Check for number of Trophies Secured by Each Captain. Show it in Bar Graph

**IV. Things That I Worked On:**

1. Python Pandas & Numpy for Analyzing the Data in the given DataFrame 

2. Seaborn & Matplotlib for Visualizing the Data

**V. Work-Flow**

1. Project is implemented by using different libraries like "Pandas", "Numpy", "Matplotlib" and "Seaborn".

2. This project is completely focused on visualizing the data by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Diwali sales dataset was read from Excel file and, This complete project is exceuted in Jupyter Notebook.

**VII. Applications & Future enhancements:**

This is an Interactive reports on Cricket Analysis. This Project is absolutely for Beginners and Intermediate Learners. The one who is cures to be part of Data Analysis this is 
absolutely for those who are likely want to learn "Python for Data Analysis". I have mainly Focused on Visualization tools by using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in this project.
